I"é<p>As of early January, 2021, Wisconsin Autonomous has a high performance, shared computer for developing and testing software. The goal of the workstation is for us to be able to run simulations, train models or do general purpose computing without each student having expensive hardware. The computer was built to be powerful, so feel free to throw some difficult tasks at it!</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In Summer 2020, because of the remote nature our club had taken on, we decided it was a good idea to create a shared workstation. The goal was to reduce the dependence each student had on their personal computers. In the selection of parts and the system configuration, powerful and easy to use were our primary goals.</p>

<p>We didnâ€™t skimp on our computer components. We spent quite a bit on parts so that you donâ€™t have to!</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>As stated earlier, we aimed for stable and easy to use software that means less problems and more development. As a result, the chosen operating system was a Linux distribution named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ubuntu</code>. As the primary operating system, this would allow us to use common remote workstation paradigms such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SSH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VNC</code>. Linux is a common operating system for programming development because of its modularity. It is also the OS we use on our vehicles. As opposed to other Linux distributions, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CentOS</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fedora</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ubuntu</code> is known to be well supported and is extremely popular.</p>

<p>Within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ubuntu</code> operating system, there are many custom configurations that were chosen to maximize modularity and ease of use. As explained in <a href="/posts/work-station-setup#cae-account">this post</a>, users are configured via COEâ€™s automatic systems. This means you do not need to create a new username and password, you can just use the CAE account you already have. Another software selection that was made was the use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modulefiles</code>. A <a href="/posts/modules">post</a> was done explaining the details of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">modulefiles</code>.</p>
