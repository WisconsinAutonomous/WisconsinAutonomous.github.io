<p>Message a leader that will have administrative rights to the organization. Good bets would be Aaron Young or Alex Pletta.</p>

<p>Here is a good template message for the leader:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hey <em>Leader Name</em>, can I be added to the github org? My wisc email is <em>WISC_ID</em>@wisc.edu and my github username is <em>GITHUB_USERNAME</em>. Iâ€™m in the <em>SUBTEAM</em> team. Thanks!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once the leader sends you an invitation, accept it within 7 days. You now have access to some or all of our private repos!</p>
