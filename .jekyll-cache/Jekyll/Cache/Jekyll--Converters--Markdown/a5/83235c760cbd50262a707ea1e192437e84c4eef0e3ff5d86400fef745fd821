I"<p>As of early January, 2021, Wisconsin Autonomous has a high performance, shared computer for developing and testing software. The goal of the workstation is for us to be able to run simulations, train models or do general purpose computing without each student having expensive hardware. The computer was built to be powerful, so feel free to throw some difficult tasks at it!</p>
