This is a guide for alley testing with any vehicle (originally written for the evGrand Prix Go-Kart).

## Driver Safety

Driving in alley needs to be approved by autonomous leaders, alley testing is not for driving for the fun of it. 

### Driver Safety Equipment

Driver is required to wear:

	- A motorcycle helmet with proper goggles if it is a dirt bike cycle helmet
	- Driving gloves
	- Boots that cover ankles
	- Jeans 
	- A long sleeve jacket

## Block the Alley

Before driving, the alley will need to be blocked off by cones on either end of the alley. 

Cones should be played at the stop signs at either end of the alley; i.e. one side the cones should be at the stop sign on the south side of the mechanical engineering building.

At least 3 people who are not driving should be present to help block off the alley.
