### If Outside of Staff Hours

Staff hours are 6:00am to 3:30pm Monday through Friday. If you plan to pick up a vehicle outside of these hours, to access the fleet office, use your _reservation number/ID_ as the passcord into the building.

### Getting the Keys

Once you enter, turn to your right and enter the _reservation number/ID_ to have the keys dispensed. 

## Returning the Vehicle

### Gas

Before returning to the office, double check your vehicle gas level. If it’s still high don’t worry about re-filling, but if it's low then use the fuel card stored with the keys and go to a gas station to refill.

### Returning the Keys

Return the vehicle to the same place as [described earlier](#pick-up-the-vehicle). Once parked and locked, Return to the keys to the drop-box located at the fleet office (where you picked up the keys).
