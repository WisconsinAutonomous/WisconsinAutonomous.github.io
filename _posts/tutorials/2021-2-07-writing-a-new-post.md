This post outlines how to write a new post and deploy it to the GitHub hosted website.

## Setup

In order to write a new post, you will need to clone the [repository](https://github.com/WisconsinAutonomous/WisconsinAutonomous.github.io). This can be done with the following command:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/WisconsinAutonomous/WisconsinAutonomous.github.io.git
```

This will basically download the code to your system so you can edit it.
