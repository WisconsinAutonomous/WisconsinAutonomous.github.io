As of early January, 2021, Wisconsin Autonomous has a high performance, shared computer for developing and testing software. The goal of the workstation is for us to be able to run simulations, train models or do general purpose computing without each student having expensive hardware. The computer was built to be powerful, so feel free to throw some difficult tasks at it!

In this post, some background will be provided about the computer, guidelines for use will be described and some user setup requirements will be explained. If you're just trying to create a `cae` account, [jump to this section](#cae-account).

## Background

In Summer 2020, because of the remote nature our club had taken on, we decided it was a good idea to create a shared workstation. The goal was to reduce the dependence each student had on their personal computers. In the selection of parts and the system configuration, powerful and easy to use were our primary goals.

### Parts List

We didn't skimp on our computer components. We spent quite a bit on parts so that you don't have to!

| Component  | Name |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| CPU  | AMD Threadripper 3960X 3.8 GHz 24-Core |
| CPU Cooler  | Dark Rock Pro TR4 59.5 |
| Motherboard  | MSI TRX40 PRO WIFI ATX sTRX4 Motherboard  |
| Memory  | G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 64 GB (4 x 16 GB)  |
| Storage  | 	Crucial P1 1 TB M.2-2280 NVME SSD  |
| Video Card (x2)  | NVIDIA RTX 2070 SUPER  |
| Case  | 	Phanteks Enthoo Pro ATX Full Tower  |
| Power Supply  | 	SeaSonic FOCUS Plus Gold 1000 W 80+  |

### Software

As stated earlier, we aimed for stable and easy to use software that means less problems and more development. As a result, the chosen operating system was a Linux distribution named `Ubuntu`. As the primary operating system, this would allow us to use common remote workstation paradigms such as `SSH` and `VNC`. Linux is a common operating system for programming development because of its modularity. It is also the OS we use on our vehicles. As opposed to other Linux distributions, such as `CentOS` or `Fedora`, `Ubuntu` is known to be well supported and is extremely popular.

Within the `Ubuntu` operating system, there are many custom configurations that were chosen to maximize modularity and ease of use. As explained in [a later section](#cae-account), users are configured via COE's automatic systems. This means you do not need to create a new username and password, you can just use the CAE account you already have. Another software selection that was made was the use of `modulefiles`. A [post](/posts/modules) was done explaining the details of `modulefiles`.

## Use Guidelines

The computer was built so that many people could use it at the same time. When using the work station, please be respectful so that everyone has a positive experience.

## User Setup

As mentioned earlier, user accounts are created via CAE's user system. This means your login and user name is configured directly from your CAE account. For those of you already in the College of Engineering, just use your already made account. If you are in a different school or don't have a CAE account, [please see below](#cae-account).

Once you have a CAE account, you can register your wisc id with team leaders to gain access. This was done so that only team members can login to the computer. Message your team leader on Slack and we'll give you access!!

### CAE Account

If you have a CAE account, no need to read this section. For those of you without a CAE account and would like access, you can register an account [here](https://newuser.my.cae.wisc.edu/account). Once submitted, it may take a few days to receive approval.
