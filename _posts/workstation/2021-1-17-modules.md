[Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) allows users to configure a shell environment efficiently and reduce conflicting installations of packages. The main ingredients the define Modules are described in files called `modulefiles`. `modulefiles` provide instructions for how to _load_ and _unload_ specific modules, such as setting the `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH` or other environment variables. This means that multiple versions of the same software can exist on a system without actually conflicting with each other; i.e. someone could _load_ `gcc 9.3` while someone else would rather use `gcc 8.4`, of which do not actually interact with one another if their individual `modulefiles` are loaded separately.

Our work station uses Environment Modules, as it helps leaders create software packages loadable by certain members or students without breaking another persons installation. In this post, I will describe how to create a `modulefile`, where modules should be placed and how to _load_ or _unload_ modules.

## Using Modules

Modules are very easy to use, both from a leader's perspective and a student's. 

For most, you'll never need to create a `modulefile`. For those people, using modules is as simple as running one or two commands to search for available modules and then load them.

For additional research, please reference their official [website](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) and [documentation](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

### Loading a Modulefile

Loading a specific module is as easy as running the following command:
```shell
$ module load <module name>
```

This will grab the `modulefile` that describes that module and complete the instructions it describes. You may also load multiple files at once. For instance, the following command will load gcc 9.3 and cuda 11.
```shell
$ module load gcc/9.3 cuda/11
```

### Searching for a Modulefile

To run the `load` command, you'll need to know the name of a module. The names of modules can be found in a variety of ways, but the two most common are the `avail` commands and through shell completion.

The `avail` command is a way to list out every `modulefile` created on the system. An example output can be seen below.
```shell
$ module avail
anaconda/2/2019.03              boost/1.62.0        cuda/11             gcc/8.1.x
anaconda/3/                     boost/1.66.0        cuda/11.0           gcc/8.2.0
anaconda/3/2019.03              boost/1.67.0        cuda/11.1           gcc/8.2.0-el7
anaconda/3/2019.07              boost/1.67.0-py3    cuda/11.2           gcc/8.2.x
```

The `avail` command can be overwhelming, especially with a lot of modulefiles on the system. Another helpful tool is shell completion, which basically allows you to begin to type a modules name, hit tab and possible options will then display. This is done within the `load` command. An example is shown below (the `<tab>` sequence indicates the tab key was pressed).
```shell
$ module load <tab>
anaconda              			boost        		cuda             	gcc

$ module load anaconda/<tab>
anaconda/2/              		anaconda/3/

$ module load anaconda/3/<tab>
anaconda/3/2019.03		 		anaconda/3/2019.07
```

### Automatic Loading through Shell Profiles

A very common tool for automatic shell configuration is shell profile files. With shell profile files, we can tell the terminal to configure out environment _every_ time you open it up. This means you can add `module load <common module>` in your shell profile file and not have to actually run it yourself. I have already gone in depth about shells in another [post](/posts/shells), so please read through that post if you have not already.

If you haven't noticed already, there should be already be a line in your shell profile file (we'll assume it's a `bashrc` file from now on) that appears to reference modules. This command initializes your shell environment so you can run `module ...` commands. That line may look like the following:
```shell
source /usr/local/Modules/init/bash
```

***Do not edit that line!!!***

**Following** this line, you may place custom `module` specific commands to be run everytime you open a terminal. For example, some people may know they would like to use anaconda, cuda and gcc almost everytime they use the workstation. Running `module load anaconda/3/2019.03 gcc/9.3 cuda/11` everytime you open a terminal window would kind of suck. So it is advisable to add that line to your `bashrc` (or your shells equivalent).

Your `bashrc` may look something like this...
```shell
source /usr/local/Modules/init/bash

module load anaconda/3/2019.03 gcc/9.3 cuda/11
```

> Note: Although it may save time for some, do not add `module load <module>` to your `bashrc` unless necessary, as it may slow down initialization time if your terminal window.

## Work Station Configuration

For people who would like to add global packages, this section aims to explain how `modules` are organized on the work station and how `modulefiles` can be created in a sustainable manner.

### System Organization

> Warning! This is for advanced users. Please consult team leaders before taking this challenge on. 

> System configuration of modulefiles requires sudo privileges

There are two places where `module` related information is shared:
- `/usr/local/Modules/modulefiles`: The location of the `modulefiles` which are used to load specific `modules`
- `/usr/local/share`: Where the actual package files are located, i.e. where the packages are installed manually

#### Modulefiles Organization

Each `modulefile` in  `/usr/local/Modules/modulefiles` should be organized in the following way:
```
.../modulefiles
├── module1/			# Root folder for a module1
│   ├── .version		# Describes the default version for module1
│   ├── 1.0.4			# Modulefile describing how to load version 1.0.4 of module1
│   ├── 1.0.5			# Modulefile describing how to load version 1.0.5 of module1
│   ├── 2.0.0			# Modulefile describing how to load version 2.0.0 of module1
│   └── ...				# Other versions you'd like to have for module1
├── module2/			# Root folder for a module2
│   ├── .version		# Describes the default version for module2
│   └── ...				# Other versions you'd like to have for module2
└── ...					# Other modules
```

The `.version` file simply describes the default version thats loaded. As the above example describes, a `module1` may have three versions. One can load version `1.0.4` with `module load module1/1.0.4`. However, if the `.version` file says `2.0.0` is the default version, `module load module1/2.0.0` is equivalent to `module load module1`. In this example, the `.version` file would look like the following:
```
#%Module1.0
set ModulesVersion "2.0.0"
```

We want sustainability for our packages, so this structure _must_ be maintained. At some point down the road, there may be a lot of packages, so we should ensure everything's organized now.

#### Module Source Organization

Similarly to `modulefiles`, we must maintain the actual package installation in an organized manner. To do so, we structure the `/usr/local/share` as follows:
```
.../share
├── module1/			# Root folder for a module1
│   ├── 1.0.4			# Source for version 1.0.4 for module1
│   ├── 1.0.5			# Source for version 1.0.5 for module1
│   ├── 2.0.0			# Source for version 2.0.0 for module1
│   └── ...				# Other versions you'd like to have for module1
├── module2/			# Root folder for a module2
│   └── ...				# Source for other versions for module2
└── ...					# Other modules
```

### Creating a Modulefile

Please refer to the previous two sections to see how to structure your module: [`modulefile`](#modulefiles-organization) and [`module` source](#module-source-organization).

To see a quality modulefile, please see [this section](#simple-example-modulefile).

The purpose of `modulefiles`, [among others](http://modules.sourceforge.net/), is to provide dynamic loading/unloading of software packages with conflicting versioning. Essentially, environment variables are changed in `modulefiles` so the current shell is aware of specific packages installations. `modulefiles` may affect `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` because these are variables associated with the current shell session.

`modulefiles` are written in the Tool Command Language (Tcl). They are made up of processes and directives. For an in depth explanation about Tcl and `modulefile` structures, please refer to the [documentation](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modulefile.html).

For Wisconsin Autonomous, _unless you know what you're doing_, follow these steps to create a `modulefile`. ***Lines starting and ending with `===` should not be included in the actual modulefile. They are simply for explanation purposes***:

```
=== Header ===
=== Gives Module version and simple file description ===
#%Module1.0
#
# MODULE 1.0.0
#

=== ModulesHelp ===
=== Prints when module help <module> is run ===
proc ModulesHelp { } {
        puts stderr "\tSets up environment for MODULE v1.0.0\n"
}

=== module-whatis ===
=== Prints when module whatis <module> is run ===
module-whatis   "sets up environment for MODULE v1.0.0"

=== Local Variable Setup ===
=== Gives package version and source location ===
set             package MODULE
set             version 1.0.0
set             root    /usr/local/share/$package/$version

=== Environment Variable Setup ===
=== Changes environment variables to allow for interacting with the source ===
append-path     PATH    $root/bin
append-path     LD_LIBRARY_PATH $root/lib64
```

#### Simple Example Modulefile

For reference, this is an example module for CUDA v11.1.1.
```
#%Module1.0
#
# cuda 11.1.1
#
proc ModulesHelp { } {
        puts stderr "\tSets up environment for CUDA v11.1.1\n"
}

module-whatis   "sets up environment for CUDA v11.1.1"

set             package cuda
set             version 11.1.1
set             root    /usr/local/share/$package/$version

setenv          CUDA_HOME       $root

append-path     PATH    $root/bin
append-path     LD_LIBRARY_PATH $root/lib64
```
#### Complicated Example Modulefile

For reference, this is an example module for Anaconda v4.9.2.
```
#%Module 1.0
#
# anaconda3 modulefile
#
proc ModulesHelp { } {
        puts stderr "\tAdds Anaconda Python 3 to your PATH environment variable\n"
}

module-whatis   "adds Anaconda Python 3 to your PATH environment variable"

set             version 4.9.2
set             root    /usr/local/share/anaconda/$version

append-path            PATH            $root/bin

set             active_shell    [ module-info shell ]
if { "$active_shell" == "bash" } {
        set             activate_conda  "\$(command conda 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
} elseif { "$active_shell" == "zsh" } {
        set             activate_conda  "\$('conda' 'shell.zsh' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
}

if { [ module-info mode load ] } {
        puts stdout "eval $activate_conda"
} else {
        puts stdout "conda deactivate"
}

```
