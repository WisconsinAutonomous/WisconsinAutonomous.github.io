[Environment Modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) allows users to configure a shell environment efficiently and reduce conflicting installations of packages. The main ingredients the define Modules are described in files called `modulefiles`. `modulefiles` provide instructions for how to _load_ and _unload_ specific modules, such as setting the `PATH`, `PYTHONPATH` or other environment variables. This means that multiple versions of the same software can exist on a system without actually conflicting with each other; i.e. someone could _load_ `gcc 9.3` while someone else would rather use `gcc 8.4`, of which do not actually interact with one another if their individual `modulefiles` are loaded separately.

Our work station uses Environment Modules, as it helps leaders create software packages loadable by certain members or students without breaking another persons installation. In this post, I will describe how to create a `modulefile`, where modules should be placed and how to _load_ or _unload_ modules.

## Using Modules

Modules are very easy to use, both from a leader's perspective and a student's. 

For most, you'll never need to create a `modulefile`. For those people, using modules is as simple as running one or two commands to search for available modules and then load them.

For additional research, please reference their official [website](http://modules.sourceforge.net/) and [documentation](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

### Loading a Modulefile

Loading a specific module is as easy as running the following command:
```shell
$ module load <module name>
```

This will grab the `modulefile` that describes that module and complete the instructions it describes. You may also load multiple files at once. For instance, the following command will load gcc 9.3 and cuda 11.
```shell
$ module load gcc/9.3 cuda/11
```

### Searching for a Modulefile

To run the `load` command, you'll need to know the name of a module. The names of modules can be found in a variety of ways, but the two most common are the `avail` commands and through shell completion.

The `avail` command is a way to list out every `modulefile` created on the system. An example output can be seen below.
```shell
$ module avail
anaconda/2/2019.03              boost/1.62.0        cuda/11             gcc/8.1.x
anaconda/3/                     boost/1.66.0        cuda/11.0           gcc/8.2.0
anaconda/3/2019.03              boost/1.67.0        cuda/11.1           gcc/8.2.0-el7
anaconda/3/2019.07              boost/1.67.0-py3    cuda/11.2           gcc/8.2.x
```

The `avail` command can be overwhelming, especially with a lot of modulefiles on the system. Another helpful tool is shell completion, which basically allows you to begin to type a modules name, hit tab and possible options will then display. This is done within the `load` command. An example is shown below (the `<tab>` sequence indicates the tab key was pressed).
```shell
$ module load <tab>
anaconda              			boost        		cuda             	gcc

$ module load anaconda/<tab>
anaconda/2/              		anaconda/3/

$ module load anaconda/3/<tab>
anaconda/3/2019.03		 		anaconda/3/2019.07
```

### Automatic Loading through Shell Profiles

A very common tool for automatic shell configuration is shell profile files. With shell profile files, we can tell the terminal to configure out environment _every_ time you open it up. This means you can add `module load <common module>` in your shell profile file and not have to actually run it yourself. I have already gone in depth about shells in another [post](/posts/shells), so please read through that post if you have not already.

If you haven't noticed already, there should be already be a line in your shell profile file (we'll assume it's a `bashrc` file from now on) that appears to reference modules. This command initializes your shell environment so you can run `module ...` commands. That line may look like the following:
```shell
source /usr/local/Modules/init/bash
```

***Do not edit that line!!!***

**Following** this line, you may place custom `module` specific commands to be run everytime you open a terminal. For example, some people may know they would like to use anaconda, cuda and gcc almost everytime they use the workstation. Running `module load anaconda/3/2019.03 gcc/9.3 cuda/11` everytime you open a terminal window would kind of suck. So it is advisable to add that line to your `bashrc` (or your shells equivalent).

Your `bashrc` may look something like this...
```shell
source /usr/local/Modules/init/bash

module load anaconda/3/2019.03 gcc/9.3 cuda/11
```

> Note: Although it may save time for some, do not add `module load <module>` to your `bashrc` unless necessary, as it may slow down initialization time if your terminal window.
