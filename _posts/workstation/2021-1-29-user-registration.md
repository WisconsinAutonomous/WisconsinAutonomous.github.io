Members must be given access to the work station to be able to remotely connect to it. This post describes giving members access.

## User Groups

There are two user groups: `autonomous-login` and `autonomous-sudo`. `autonomous-login` gives members the ability to access the computer remotely. `autonomous-sudo` gives already existing users administrative privileges.

## Adding People to the Groups

In order to add someone to the group, you _must_ already be in that group! 

To add someone, visit [https://account.my.cae.wisc.edu/group](https://account.my.cae.wisc.edu/group). Here, you should see a table with user groups. If you are a part of `autonomous-login` and `autonomous-sudo`, it should look like the following (with possibly additional groups not related to Wisconsin Autonomous).

To add someone to the `autonomous-login` group, click `edit` under actions. Using the [group password](#getting-the-group-password), update the member list. Same goes for the `autonomous-sudo` group. 

***Please be careful with adding or removing people!***

## Getting the Group Password

To get the group password for updating the user groups, please contact Aaron Young via [email](mailto:aryoung5@wisc.edu) or slack.
