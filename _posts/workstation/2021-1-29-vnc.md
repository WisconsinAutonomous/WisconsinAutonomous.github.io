Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a powerful application that allows you to use graphical windows of a browser without being physically with the computer. By default, the work station is hidden behind a firewall. So in order to use vnc, you have to create a vncserver and forward that port to your computer.

TODO: Improve vncserver launching so you don't have to check numbers

## Setup Guide

Initial setup for vnc is pretty simple, as the package is already installed. Please SSH to the work station. Refer to [this post](/posts/ssh) for an explanation on how to do that.

### VNC Password

First, you must create a vnc password. To do this, run the following command and enter a password:
```console
user@name:~$ vncpasswd
Password:
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
```
> Note: Nothing will print out for the Password or Verify entries. This is for security reasons, so continue to type as you normally would.

### Starting a VNC Server

A vnc server is the entity that helps you run a graphical window and visualize it on your own computer. This is already installed on the workstation. 

To launch a server, run the following command:
```console
user@name:~$ vncserver

New 'carproject-06:1 (username)' desktop at :1 on machine carproject-06

Starting applications specified in /etc/X11/Xvnc-session
Log file is /filespace/a/username/.vnc/carproject-06:1.log

Use xtigervncviewer -SecurityTypes VncAuth -passwd /filespace/a/username/.vnc/passwd :1 to connect to the VNC server.
```

As you can see, the `vncserver` command will launch a vnc server and start rendering the desktop window. Take note of the number in the first line of the output, i.e. "New 'carproject-06:1 (username)' desktop at **:1** on machine carproject-06". This is your server number and will be used for connecting in the next step.

### Create a SSH Tunnel

This process is explained in more detail in [this post](/posts/ssh). 

We want to create an `ssh` tunnel for the port numbered `5900` **plus** the server number. For example, if your server number from the previous section was **:1** (see above), then your port number will be `5901`. If your server number is `11`, then your port number will be `5911`.

To create the `ssh` tunnel, run the following command (change `5901` and `<cae username>` to the correct values):
```shell
ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 -J <cae username>@best-tux.cae.wisc.edu <cae username>@carproject-06.engr.wisc.edu
```

### Connect to VNC

Now that our server is running, we can actually connect to the work station. To do this, you will need a VNC viewer. [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/) is a good selection and is available on most systems.

Once installed, create a new connection. Please refer to the documentation for your specific viewer. Here is a detailed guide for the [RealVNC Viewer](https://devanswers.co/install-vnc-ubuntu-18-04-windows-mac-linux/#VNC-Viewer-on-Windows-and-MacOS).

The url for your VNC server should be `localhost:<port number>` where `<port number>` is the same value that you used in the previous section (i.e. `localhost:5901`).

When prompted for a password, use the password you created in the [VNC Password](#vnc-password) section.

#### Mac Users

Mac users can simply use Finder to run a VNC session. To do this, open finder, hit âŒ˜K. A window should pop up and you should type the vnc url from the previous section with the prefix `vnc://`. Hit connect and you should be good to go! Should be something similar to the image below.

### Using VNC

Once the viewer opens, you may be prompted to login. Use the same password as your cae account. From there, you can use the work station like any other computer! You should see something similar to this.

### Killing a VNC Server

When done, ensure that you kill/shutdown the vnc server. To that, run the following command:
```shell
vncserver -kill :1
```
> Note: Replace `:1` with whatever server number you used before

## Black Screen Issue

After you VNC in to the server, you may run into the issue of only seeing a black screen. To solve this, modify the file at ~/.vnc/xstartup to contain the following contents:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
unset SESSION_MANAGER
exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
vncconfig -iconic &
xterm -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
twm &
```
