# Joining the WA Github Org

#### Step 1
[Join our Slack group](/wa_wiki/fundamentals/joining-the-wa-slack-group.html).

#### Step 2
Message a leader that will have administrative rights to the organization. Good bets would be Aaron Young or Alex Pletta.

Here is a good template message for the leader:
> Hey *Leader Name*, can I be added to the github org? My wisc email is *WISC_ID*@wisc.edu and my github username is *GITHUB_USERNAME*. I'm in the *SUBTEAM* team. Thanks!

#### Step 3
Once the leader sends you an invitation, accept it within 7 days. You now have access to some or all of our private repos!
